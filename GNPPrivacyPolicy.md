Genesis Network Protocol Privacy Policy

The Genesis Network Protocol does not collect, store, transmit, or process any personal data. All Vaults are generated locally in-browser and stored client-side. No servers, databases, or third-party trackers are used.

Your Vault ID, mnemonic phrase, and Genesis Seal barcode are pseudonymous and remain entirely under your control. No IP addresses, names, emails, or device identifiers are collected.

Genesis is designed for privacy, permanence, and protest. Your participation is anonymous, symbolic, and free from surveillance.

If you export your Vault, it remains encrypted and stored locally. No data is shared with the Genesis Network or any external entity.
