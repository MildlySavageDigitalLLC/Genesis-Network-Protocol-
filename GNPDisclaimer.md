Genesis Network Protocol Disclaimer

Genesis Digital Collector’s Seals (DCS) are symbolic digital artifacts minted in response to sovereign debt increases. They carry no monetary value, cannot be traded, sold, or exchanged, and are not recognized by any financial institution or government entity.

Participation in the Genesis Protocol is ideological and voluntary. No Seal implies ownership, investment, or financial gain. All Vaults are pseudonymous and sealed permanently.

Genesis is not a currency, not a financial product, and not a payment mechanism. It is a timestamp of belief, protest, and remembrance—nothing more.

By using this protocol, you acknowledge its symbolic nature and waive all financial expectations or claims.
