Title: Genesis Network Protocol — Digital Collector’s Seal (DCS)

Author: Mule’ Tubman  
Inspired by: The Genesis Treaty by Tony Lamont and the Nesara/Gesara Movement

Abstract:
The Genesis Network Protocol is a decentralized, open-source framework built for ideological resistance—not monetary function. It mints Digital Collector’s Seals (DCS) upon each $1 million increase in U.S. national debt using real-time external data. Genesis is not a currency, not a financial asset, and holds no tradable or speculative value. It is a symbolic system of protest, pseudonymous participation, and transparent documentation of economic decay.

Core Framework:
- Digital Seals minted per $1M debt increase
- Total Supply: 3.25B DCS  
   ↳ 2.25B Sealed in Memorial Link, unreachable  
   ↳ 1B available via minting protocol
- No trading, no sending, no receiving
- Vaults hold Seals permanently; no value attached
- Barcode-based validation, pseudonymous identity
- Universal Chain Link (UCL) records every mint as a Link
- Genesis Network Protocol is powered by Proof of Data—not simulation, not speculation

Disclaimer:
Participation in Genesis is symbolic. No wallet, Seal, or barcode implies ownership or financial value. The Genesis Protocol will never be used as a payment medium, investment scheme, or monetary exchange mechanism.

Powered by protest. Preserved in code. Protected by clarity.
