Genesis Network Protocol User Agreement

By accessing or interacting with the Genesis Network Protocol, you agree to the following terms:

1. You understand that Genesis Digital Collector’s Seals (DCS) are symbolic and carry no monetary value.
2. You will not attempt to trade, sell, or assign value to any DCS.
3. You will not use Genesis Vaults or Seals for financial transactions or speculative behavior.
4. You acknowledge that your Vault is pseudonymous and locally stored—no personal data is collected or transmitted.
5. You agree to uphold the ideological and symbolic nature of the protocol and refrain from any misuse that could imply financial utility.

Violation of these terms may result in Vault invalidation or Seal rejection. This agreement is non-financial, non-commercial, and purely symbolic.
