Generate ideological protest with Digital Collector Seals (DCS) in response to sovereign debt

# Genesis Network Protocol

A decentralized, browser-based protocol for minting **Digital Collector’s Seals (DCS)**—symbolic artifacts forged in response to sovereign debt increases. Genesis is not a currency, not an investment, and not a financial instrument. It is a timestamp of protest, sealed in code.

**Author:** Mule’ Tubman  
**Inspired by:** The Genesis Treaty (Tony Lamont), Nesara/Gesara movement

## 🔥 Core Features
- Mint-only logic (no send/receive)
- Real-time U.S. Debt data triggers DCS creation
- Vault system stores Seals permanently
- Unique barcode per Vault for pseudonymous validation
- Universal Chain Link (UCL) records each mint as a Link
- UCL Archive UI for timestamped history
- No servers, no simulation—pure JavaScript
- GitHub Pages deployable

## 🧬 Terminology
- **DCS**: Digital Collector’s Seal — symbolic artifact, no monetary value
- **Vault**: Pseudonymous wallet storing Seals
- **Link**: Each block minted in response to debt increase
- **Memorial Link**: Genesis Block holding 2.25B sealed DCS
- **UCL**: Universal Chain Link — the blockchain structure
- **UCL Archive**: Ledger of all Links
- **Genesis Seal**: Logo and scannable badge tied to Vault identity

## 📜 Legal Positioning
Genesis is a symbolic protocol. It cannot be traded, sold, or used for payment. All Seals are minted as ideological timestamps. No financial value is assigned or implied.
